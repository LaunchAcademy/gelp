# Helen this test is what I was talking to you about when you were leaving.
# It looks so stupid and I hate it, but it works, which I also hate.
# The commented part is what you had suggested, it looked like it was going to be much prettier.
# I was not smart enough for it. Saddness abounds.
# Signed,
# Your friend,
# Michael
#
# P.S. The github URL demands a URL, including http:// before it, despite us not making it do that.
# witchcraft is suspected.
