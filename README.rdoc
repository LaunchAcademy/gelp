== Gelp

Gelp is a three person group project built while attending Launch Academy. It is a site for reviewing Ruby Gems. We worked on this project as a group during the last couple weeks of Launch Academy when we weren't working on our breakable toys.

Helen Hood https://github.com/hchood was our Group Mentor.

It was great working with everyone and I'm really happy with how the group worked out. Look for these people on career day!  - Michael
